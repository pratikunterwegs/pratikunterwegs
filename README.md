ðŸ’¼ I work at the ![Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/events/series/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases), at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and in the ![Epiverse Initiative at Data.org](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

Previously a field ecologist, I worked with spatial trajectory data and individual based simulation models for my PhD in ecology and evolution.
