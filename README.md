### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a field ecologist, now working with spatial data and simulation models. Links to my projects are below the titles.

### A Guide to High-throughput Animal Tracking Data

I wrote a guide to building pre-processing pipelines for high-throughput animal tracking data, and built and still maintain the `R` package `atlastools`.

### Mechanistic Evolutionary Simulations

In the [Modelling Adaptive Response Mechanisms group](marmgroup.eu) I work on evolutionary, individual-based models of animal movement, and especially the co-evolution of animal movement and competition strategies.


### Massive Citizen Science Data

[![eBird Occupancy Modelling](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github-eBird_Occupancy_Modelling-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/pratikunterwegs/hillybirds)

I use eBird data from the Western Ghats in India to model the occupancy of birds in tropical mountains in relation to land cover and climate.
